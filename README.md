I had to get a new muffler for my Toyota Tacoma, and I realized that the prices from one Toyota dealer to the next can swing wildly and there was no easy way to comparison shop dealers for prices of parts.  In a Jupyter Notebook, I made a python script to scrape +100 dealer websites for the price of the muffler so I could see who sold it the cheapest.  I ended up turning my script into this django app to scrape a few dealers for any part.  This was my very first Django project and building this was the reason I became interested in Django.
