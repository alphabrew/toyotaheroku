# toyotaheroku

I had to get a new muffler for my Toyota Tacoma, and I realized that the prices from one dealer to the next can swing wildly and there was no easy way to comparison shop dealers.  In a Jupyter Notebook, I made a python script to scrape +100 dealer websites for the price of the muffler.  I ended up turning it into a django app to scrape a few dealers for any part.  This was my very first Django project and building this was the reason I became interested in Djano.
